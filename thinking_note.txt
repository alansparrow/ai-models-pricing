[2025-06-15 10:00] Initial Codebase Analysis

## Project Overview
Analyzing the ai-models-pricing repository to understand its structure and purpose.

## Key Findings
1. **Project Type**: This appears to be a simple data repository focused on storing AI model pricing information
2. **Main Components**:
   - pricing-data.json: Contains structured pricing data for various Claude models
   - README.md: Currently minimal (only has title)
   - No programming language files, build tools, or package managers detected

## Architecture Analysis
- The project follows a simple data storage pattern
- pricing-data.json is well-structured with:
  - Metadata section (source, dates, version info)
  - Models array containing pricing details for 7 Claude models
  - Each model has input/output prices and cache pricing tiers (5m and 1h)
  - Both per-token and original per-million-token rates are stored

## Technology Stack
- No specific programming languages or frameworks
- Pure JSON data storage
- Git for version control

## Notable Observations
1. The pricing data is sourced from Anthropic's official documentation
2. Prices are stored both in per-token format (for calculations) and original format (for reference)
3. The repository is very minimal - likely meant as a data source for other applications
4. No tests, build scripts, or CI/CD configuration present

## TODO/Future Considerations
- README.md could be enhanced with usage instructions
- Could benefit from validation scripts to ensure JSON format
- Might need versioning strategy if pricing updates frequently
